# Introduction to Data-Analysis with Pandas

## Follow-along tutorial PyData Berlin 2017

Pandas is the Swiss-Multipurpose Knife for Data Analysis in Python. With Pandas dealing with data-analysis is easy and simple but there are some things you need to get your head around first as Data-Frames and Data-Series.
